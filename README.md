## Why to use

The use case for these Gerbers is for prototyping, where you know you'll be using an ESP32 but the rest of the board layout may not be finalized enough to warrant ordering stencils.

## How to use

Simply provide the Gerber file for the appropriate variant to your fab. They'll send back a stencil you can use for that ESP32 processor on any PCB.
